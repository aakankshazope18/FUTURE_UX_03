UI/UX Design Task 3 – CRM / Client Management Dashboard UI

-- Project Overview

This project is a web-based CRM (Client Relationship Management) Dashboard UI designed for a digital marketing agency managing multiple leads, clients, tasks, and follow-ups.
The dashboard simulates a real B2B SaaS product, focusing on workflow efficiency, clarity, and scalability.
It is designed to help agencies centralize their operations instead of relying on spreadsheets or scattered tools.

Plan follow-ups & internal tasks
Monitor overall agency activity

-- Project Objective

Lead tracking pipeline
